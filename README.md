# Digit-Recognition-ML
This small program aims at exploring Machine Learning in digit recognition with various algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine(SVM), Random Forest Classifiers, KNN, Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Baes and Decision Tree.

These all algorithms perform differently with K-Nearest Neighbour classifier turning out to be the best with about 99% accuracy, seconded by SVM with 98% and so on.

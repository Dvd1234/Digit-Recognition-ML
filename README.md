# Digit-Recognition-ML
This small program aims at exploring Machine Learning in digit recognition with various algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine(SVM), Random Forest Classifiers, KNN, Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Baes and Decision Tree from Sklearn library.

These all algorithms perform differently with K-Nearest Neighbour classifier turning out to be the best with about 99% accuracy, seconded by SVM with 98% and so on. 
The Prediction DIgit Recognition contains an image predicted by the algorithm while the Compare Accuracy image shows the accuracy of various algorithms in predicting. The test-train-split had test set as 25% of the entire dataset.
